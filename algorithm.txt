Scenario for one elevator:

1. As long as there’s someone inside or ahead of the elevator who wants to go in the current direction, keep heading in that direction.
2. Once the elevator has exhausted the requests in its current direction, switch directions if there’s a request in the other direction. Otherwise, stop and wait for a call.


Scenario for two elevators:
1. General rule same as for one
2. The second elevator won't go to the floor if there's no other requests and the first elevator isn't busy
3. The second elevator will be keen to returning to 0 floor after completing its tasks (it's the most popular floor)
